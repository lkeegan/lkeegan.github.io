## About me

I am a research software engineer in the
[Scientific Software Center](https://ssc.uni-heidelberg.de)
of the
[University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en),
where I work with researchers from all disciplines on a range of different [research software development projects](projects.html),
using a variety of tech stacks including c++, Python and web development.
I also give [talks and courses](teaching.html) on software development topics
for researchers and scientists, and [contribute](open-source.html) to a variety of open source projects.

I previously worked as a scientific software developer in the
[Department for modelling of biological processes](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research-groups/modelling-of-biological-processes),
where I developed
[Spatial Model Editor](https://spatial-model-editor.github.io/),
a GUI tool to edit and simulate spatial models of bio-chemical reactions.

Prior to that I was (briefly) a scientific software engineer in the HPC group
of the
[Blue Brain Project](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/),
where I added symbolic math features to the
[NMODL source-to-source compiler](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl)
to speed up brain tissue model simulations, see these
[conference proceedings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02241.pdf)
for more details.

Before that I worked as a theoretical particle physicist at ETH Zurich, CERN,
and other research institutes, using super computers to simulate quantum field
theories.
See the [physics](physics.html) page for some of my research publications and talks.
