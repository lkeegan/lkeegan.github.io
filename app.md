## This is a test PWA app

You should be able to install it from your phone/tablet web browser
(look for "Install app" or similar in the browser settings)

## Once installed

There should be an icon added to your home screen.
If you click on this icon on your device,
it should open this page in full screen mode,
with no way for the user to navigate away from this web site.

## To close it

On android swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings,
from there you should be able to close the app somehow...
