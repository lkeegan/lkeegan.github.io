    I am a research software engineer in the
    <a href="https://ssc.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">Scientific Software Center</a>
    of the
    <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en">University of Heidelberg</a>,
    where I work on a range of different research software development projects,
    typically involving c++ and/or Python. I also give talks and courses on
    software development topics for researchers and scientists, see the
    <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a> page for slides and code samples.
  </p>
  <p>
    I previously worked as a scientific software developer in the
    <a
      href="https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research-groups/modelling-of-biological-processes"
      >Department for modelling of biological processes</a
    >, where I developed
    <a href="https://spatial-model-editor.github.io/">spatial-model-editor</a>,
    a GUI tool to edit and simulate 2d spatial models of bio-chemical reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to that I was (briefly) a scientific software engineer in the HPC
    group of the
    <a href="https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/">Blue Brain Project</a>, where I added
    symbolic math features to the the
    <a href="https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl"
      >NMODL source-to-source compiler</a
    >
    to speed up brain tissue model simulations, see these
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02241.pdf">conference proceedings</a>
    for more details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that I worked as a theoretical particle physicist at ETH Zurich,
    CERN, and other research institutes, using super computers to simulate
    quantum field theories. See the
    <a href="physics.html">physics</a> page for some of my research publications
    and talks.
